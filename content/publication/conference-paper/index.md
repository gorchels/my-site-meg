abstract: Adapting to climate change, coupled with the need to address aging infrastructure, population growth, and degraded ecosystems, requires significant investment in natural and built water systems. These investments present a significant opportunity to support not only water, but to provide economic, social, and environmental benefits. By considering co-benefits, water managers can increase funding through collaborative partnerships and co-funding opportunities, build partnerships, and garner public support.This guidebook uses a “multi-benefit framework” to provide a modular, flexible approach for water managers interested in incorporating multiple benefits into water management decisions. It can be applied to a wide range of projects and programs, from designing water efficiency programs to prioritizing stormwater project funding and developing co-funding models for multi-benefit projects. A list of “Dos” and “Don’ts” is provided, covering everything from project vision to defining key metrics and communicating with decision-makers.
