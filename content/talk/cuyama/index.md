abstract: The Cuyama groundwater basin faces extreme challenges due to production of water thirsty crops like carrots and alfalfa. The groundwater levels have fallen hundreds of feet since the 1950s and has become contaminated through over application of nitrogen fertilizer. To address these issues, significant changes are required in the new groundwater management plan.
