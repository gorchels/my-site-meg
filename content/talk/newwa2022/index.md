abstract: One of the primary sources of uncertainty in water auditing and water loss analysis is the accuracy of source meters because they record the large volume of water in the audit, water supplied. This presentation showed case studies of source meter testing techniques, summary results from many source meter tests conducted throughout the country, and the potential impact of those test results on the findings from the water audit.
