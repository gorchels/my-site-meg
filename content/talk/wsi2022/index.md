abstract: Quantifying the benefits of distribution system leak detection is a difficult task given the high level of uncertainty associated with leak flow rates and durations. Recognizing the need for more data and studies on leak detection, MWDOC partnered with E Source to create a leak detection database. To date, MWDOC has completed 32 surveys covering over 2,200 miles of main, resulting in a database with over 900 leak detection findings. Using the database, MWDOC and E Source aimed to answer the following questions (1) How variable are flow rate measurements and estimates?, (2) Is leak detection cost-effective?, and (3) Is it reasonable to set a standardized water saving metric per mile of leak detection? If so, at what level should it be set?
