I focus on bringing together diverse stakeholders to increase community resilience. Through my experience working on green stormwater infrastructure, aquatic ecosystems, and community water quality, I've seen how water uniquely connects people to the environment. As climate change affects this resource reliability, focusing on water equity work will be crucial for bringing environmental investment to places most in need of resilience.

Some fun facts: Iâ€™ve hiked the mountain on the Toblerone bar; my kitten, Comet, is helping me write this; I recently found the perfect to lemon almond cake recipe for tea with friends.
